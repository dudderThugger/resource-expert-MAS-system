Our goal: to democratize climate action and help reduce or avoid one billion metric tons (a \"gigaton\") of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Through Project Gigaton, we encourage suppliers to take action in six action areas that are key to decarbonization and relevant to our suppliers' businesses.\n\nPROJECT GIGATON PILLARS\n\nOver the past six years, we have expanded and deepened our work by adding new tools, resources, and other opportunities for suppliers to accelerate engagement and impact. For example, as part of Project Gigaton, Walmart collaborated with Schneider Electric to provide access to accelerators like Gigaton PPA, which offers suppliers the opportunity to participate in aggregate, utility-scale power purchase agreements. We also worked with CDP and HSBC to launch the Sustainable Supply Chain Finance Program, an early-payment program for suppliers who set science-based targets through Project Gigaton or have achieved certain score thresholds from CDP. As Project Gigaton continues to make progress across areas of the supply chain critical to decarbonization, Walmart is focused on increasing supplier engagement and ambition and catalyzing positive action.\n\nEnergy\n\n· Gigaton PPA\n\n· Tools and playbooks\n\nNature\n\n.

The initiative aspires to distribute at least 40% of net income to directly support community-based conservation and climate resilience projects\n\nincluding the development and management of Marine Protected Areas and coral reef restoration. We also collaborate with Indigo Ag to source Great Value rice from a place-based initiative in Arkansas. Rice farmers enrolled in the project implement on-farm practices that are intended to improve water and land stewardship, including crop rotation from legumes, fertilizer management, zero-grade rice production, multiple-inlet irrigation with computerized holes election, and furrow irrigation.\n\nSee our Regeneration of Natural Resources ESG brief for more information\n\n###PAGE###\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nWalmart\n\nWaste: Circular Economy\n\nOur aspiration: to achieve zero waste in our global operations and accelerate the adoption of innovative packaging and products designed for circularity\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n· Achieve zero operational waste\n\n· Eliminate food waste\n\n· Optimize packaging and encourage customer recycling\n\nFY2023 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n· Reduced food waste 12% (vs. 2016 baseline); diverted >900M lbs. of food waste to composting, animal feed, anaerobic digestion, and biochemical processing; and donated >760M Ibs. of food globally30\n\n· 63% of global private brand packaging was recyclable, reusable, or industrially compostable31\n\n· Reduce plastic waste\n\n· Engage customers in the circular economy\n\n.

Our team began working closely with the state of Florida's Emergency Operations Center, where they would remain embedded for more than a week to help coordinate with local facilities, emergency responders, and local leaders. The storm brought historic flooding and rainfall and hundreds of Walmart stores, clubs, and distribution centers in its path were affected, with dozens losing power and suffering damage from wind and water. Shortly after the storm passed, stores and clubs began to reopen to safely resume serving customers and members.\n\nCustomers, members, and associates saw significant damage to their homes and were left without utilities and water. To meet community needs, Walmart locations hosted services and water and meal distributions in their parking lots. Nonprofits including Cajun Navy Relief and The Salvation Army worked alongside our associates to help get resources like water, food, and emergency supplies to people in need. While power remained down for many across the region, some of our parking lots also hosted shower and laundry services, including P&G's Tide Loads of Hope.\n\nIntroduction Opportunity\n\nSustainability\n\nCommunity\n\nEthics & Integrity\n\n29\n\nWalmart private fleet drivers poured into the region from across the country, delivering an additional 3,800 truckloads of water to support stores and clubs and for distribution to communities and local nonprofits.\n\nWalmart truck drivers also brought relief to the community through Walmart's Mobile Relief Kitchen, a fully equipped cooking trailer designed for disaster response. For several weeks, these associates cooked and served over 84,000 hot meals.\n\nLøg\n\nWalmart driver Greg Carter, who is based in Indiana, traveled to Florida to work at the Mobile Relief Kitchen with his fellow associates.

Walmart fills the needs of communities - not only when times are good, but especially when times are bad.\"\n\nOverall, Walmart, Sam's Club, and the Walmart Foundation donated over $6 million in grants and supplies that helped nonprofits feed and shelter people, clean up debris, and provide relief to underserved communities.\n\nSee more in our Hurricane lan timeline.\n\n###PAGE###\n\nWalmart\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nEthics & Integrity\n\nCode\n\nWalmart strives to make trust a competitive advantage.

Last year, we blocked approximately 8.5 billion bots per month.\n\n1:11 1 Exit\n\nScan & Go Cart .Il LTE Wn Fashion Tee $5.98 Qty 1 V Weighable produce (1)\n\n×\n\nYou'll be able to weigh produce at self checkout\n\nSummary\n\nSubtotal (2 items)\n\n$5.98\n\nTax\n\n$0.52\n\nEstimated total\n\n$6.50\n\n[ii] Scan items\n\nPEACH YELLOW HM $1.78/1b Cost to be calculated by weight\n\n×\n\nAdd item with no barcode Remove all items\n\nEstimated total $6.50\n\nCheck out\n\n###PAGE###\n\nWalmart\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nIntroduction\n\nOpportunity\n\nSustainability\n\nCommunity\n\nEthics & Integrity\n\n37\n\nHuman Rights\n\nOur aspiration: to use our scale, capabilities, and influence to help people and communities improve their lives, with a focus on our salient human rights issues\n\nSALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES\n\nWalmart focuses its efforts on its identified salient human rights issues:\n\nSTRATEGY\n\n· Identify salient human rights issues and focus areas most relevant to our business\n\n· Govern our approach to human rights in accordance with our Human Rights Statement, including oversight by management and the Walmart Board of Directors\n\n· Manage salient human rights issues in our operations and supply chains, including through policies, engagement, assessing impacts, integration of findings, performance tracking, and appropriate remedy\n\nFY2023 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n· >400 suppliers set goals and/or reported progress on responsible recruitment through Walmart's Supplier Leadership Program on People\n\n· Financially supported the creation of a data ecosystem and engagement channels to empower and promote the responsible recruitment of migrant workers in the U.S .- Mexico agriculture corridor\n\n· Began a refresh of our human rights due diligence approaches, including re-examining our salient issues, focus areas, governance, policies, and practices\n\n· Participated in the Owned Operations working group of the Consumer Goods Forum, which includes Human Rights Due Diligence activities\n\nTreating Workers with Respect\n\n· Pay; working hours\n\n· Freedom of association and collective bargaining\n\n· Meaningful opportunities for workers to be heard\n\n+\n\nPromoting a Safe & Healthy Work Environment\n\n· Physical safety and security of work premises\n\n· Workplace abuse\n\n· Healthy work environments\n\nProviding a Fair & Inclusive Work Environment · Anti-discrimination and harassment\n\n· Diversity and inclusion\n\n· Gender equity\n\nCombating Forced & Underage Labor\n\n· Forced labor, including debt bondage\n\n· Underage labor\n\n· Vulnerability of migrant workers; responsible recruitment\n\n· Human trafficking\n\nSee our Human Rights ESG brief for more information\n\n###PAGE###\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nWalmart\n\nAppendix\n\n###PAGE###\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nWalmart\n\nIntroduction Opportunity\n\nAbout Our Reporting\n\nSustainability\n\nCommunity\n\nEthics & Integrity\n\n39\n\nWalmart has reported on a wide range of ESG issues since 2005. Our reporting is focused on our priority ESG issues - those that we believe are the most relevant to our business and important to our stakeholders.\n\nEach priority issue is covered in-depth in our ESG Issue Briefs. The briefs cover our aspirations and strategies with respect to that issue, the relevance of the issue to business and society, our key goals and metrics, and our progress to date. These briefs will be updated from time to time and may not align with fiscal year reporting periods.\n\nThese ESG Highlights provide an overview of our shared value approach to ESG, our ESG priorities, and key highlights from the year, but it is not intended to be comprehensive. This report covers activities during the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (FY2023), except as otherwise noted. Calendar years (CY) are marked as such or written in a four-digit format. As we highlight each issue in this report, we provide links to the relevant issue brief or briefs.\n\nNew this year, we are sharing our key ESG metrics as a downloadable spreadsheet to make it easier for our stakeholders to get the information they need. This spreadsheet will be updated from time to time as new information becomes available.\n\nWe sought and received external assurance from a third party with respect to certain emissions-related information. We did not seek or receive external assurance from third parties with respect to other information,\n\nalthough in certain instances third parties assisted in the process of collecting, analyzing, and calculating information.\n\nOur reporting is guided by widely used voluntary reporting frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the United Nations (U.N.) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We also report through programs such as CDP, a global environmental disclosure system. Please see our GRI, SASB, TCFD, and UN SDGs tables for more information.\n\nAll references to \"Walmart\" in our ESG reporting are to Walmart Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries that were subsidiaries during the reporting period, excluding all acquired eCommerce businesses, platforms, and/or marketplaces, unless otherwise noted. Financial information referenced in our ESG reporting reflects the scope of the Walmart Inc. consolidated financial statements unless otherwise noted. This report also covers some activities of the Walmart Foundation, a separately incorporated Delaware charitable private foundation. \"Walmart.org\" is used to refer to the collective philanthropy of Walmart Inc. and the Walmart Foundation.\n\n###PAGE###\n\nWalmart\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThese ESG Highlights and our various ESG Issue Briefs do not cover all information about our business, and inclusion of information therein is not an indication that the subject or information is material to Walmart's business or operating results for purposes of U.S. securities laws and regulations. Statements other than statements of historical or current facts, including statements and images about our ESG targets, goals, aspirations, commitments and programs, and other business plans, initiatives, and objectives are forward-looking statements and are based on Walmart management's current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words \"aim,\" \"ambition,\" \"anticipate,\" \"aspire,\" \"believe,\" \"can,\" \"commit,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"goal,\" \"hope,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"on track,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"strive,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" or other similar words. All such statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our actual future results, including the achievement of our targets, goals, or commitments, could differ materially from our projected results as the result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in circumstances, assumptions not being realized, or other risks, uncertainties, and factors, many of which are outside of our control. Such risks, uncertainties and factors include the risk factors discussed in Item 1A of our most recent Highlight Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); they also include the challenges, assumptions and dependencies identified in our ESG Issue\n\nIntroduction Opportunity\n\nSustainability\n\nCommunity\n\nEthics & Integrity\n\n40\n\nBriefs. We urge you to consider all of the risks, uncertainties, and factors identified above or discussed in these ESG Highlights and each of our ESG Issue Briefs carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements therein. Walmart cannot assure you that the results reflected or implied by any forward-looking statement will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that those results will have the forecasted or expected consequences and effects. Unless expressly stated otherwise, the forward-looking statements in these ESG Highlights and our ESG Issue Briefs are made as of the effective date identified in the issue brief, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Standards of measurement and performance made in reference to the goals, aspirations, and objectives referred to in these ESG Highlights and our various ESG Issue Briefs are developing and based on protocols, processes, and assumptions that continue to evolve and are subject to change in the future, and no assurances can be given that any plan, initiative, projection, goal, commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in these ESG Highlights or our ESG Issue Briefs can or will be achieved.\n\n###PAGE###\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nWalmart\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Average total compensation includes average hourly pay, other compensation, and benefits per hour for full- and part-time associates. This does not include special cash bonuses or paid leave related to COVID-19.\n\n2 The calculation excludes the following associate types: Home Office, pharmacists, on-site-clinics, drivers, management trainees, and temporary associates.\n\n3 Data for promotions includes both hourly and management promotions and excludes Walmart Home Office promotions.\n\n4 Calculation is for associates working in stores, clubs, and supply chain.\n\n5 A diverse supplier is defined as a U.S. privately held company that is recognized as at least 51% owned and operated by a woman, minority, veteran, disabled veteran, a person with a disability, or a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) community. All references to \"diverse suppliers\" in this report follow this definition.\n\n6 Calculation is for associates working in stores, clubs, and supply chain.\n\n7 Data for promotions includes both hourly and management promotinos and excludes Walmart Home Office promotions.\n\n8 Wage metrics in the table exclude the following associate types: Home Office associates, pharmacists, on-site-clinics, drivers, management trainees, and temporary associates.\n\n9 The average hourly starting rate is calculated as the average hourly wage of U.S. associates that joined in the preceding six months. Starting wage ranges were $12-$32/hour (Walmart U.S.), $15-$32/hour (Sam's Club U.S.), and $16-$30 (supply chain). The minimum starting wage rate was increased to $14/hour in Walmart U.S. in February 2023.\n\n10 Average total compensation includes average hourly pay, other compensation, and benefits per hour for full-and part-time associates. This does not include special cash bonuses or paid leave related to COVID-19.\n\n11 This segment includes Walmart U.S. stores and supply chain.\n\n12 This segment includes Sam's Clubs and supply chain.\n\n13 Supply chain includes associates who work in distribution and fulfillment centers but excludes drivers.\n\n14 U.S. metrics include all 50 states but exclude Puerto Rico. U.S. non-management metrics include all hourly associates, excluding temporary associates. U.S. management metrics include all salaried, exempt associates. U.S. officer metrics include president, executive vice president, senior vice president, and vice\n\nIntroduction\n\nOpportunity\n\npresident positions. Data for the U.S. is as of January 31.\n\n15 As reported by grantee organizations. Farmers may benefit from more than one investment or program. Each engagement will be included in calculating total reach.\n\n16 Calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, available on the Walmart Sustainability Hub. Suppliers submit information during a Project Gigaton reporting season; figures reported are for the reporting season that took place during the corresponding fiscal year. Because Walmart does not restrict suppliers to reporting only on emissions avoidance and reduction efforts that are attributable to the suppliers' business with Walmart, actions taken and reported through Project Gigaton cannot be used to measure Walmart's Scope 3 emissions, either absolutely or in year-over-year reductions.\n\n17 Annual Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions are updated from time to time for changes in emission factors or activity data when more accurate information become available. This may result in updated emissions reported in the ESG Climate Change brief that may not correspond to results reported to CDP for our annual Climate Change questionnaire. Flipkart emissions data is excluded from Walmart's Scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint and progress calculation. We believe excluding Flipkart's data will have negligible impact on the overall reporting.\n\nWe engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify Walmart's reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions as reported to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of Greenhouse Gas inventories). We follow Walmart's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology in calculating our GHG emissions, which is consistent with the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (\"The GHG Protocol\") for corporate GHG accounting and reporting. Scope 2 (market-based) emissions include the carbon reduction value of renewable electricity procured from onsite and offsite projects.\n\nTo account for structural changes in our business, we strive to adjust our emission reduction progress on Scope 1 and 2 emissions to add or subtract emissions for entities acquired or divested in the year the acquisition or divestiture took place, including adjusting for previous years (including the baseline year).\n\n18 For the time frame of the private brands packaging survey, we instructed suppliers to use their latest or most recent 12-month period for which they have data available. If they reported last year, use the same reporting period as the initial/prior reporting year to avoid gaps or overlap with the prior year's submissions. For suppliers that did not complete the survey or provided unusable data, proxy data was substituted to provide a full estimate of global private brand packaging. For the proxy calculation, a market level approach was used.\n\n19 Includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. fresh and frozen, wild-caught and farmed seafood. Sourced from fisheries that are third-party certified as more sustainable, actively working toward\n\nSustainability Community Ethics & Integrity\n\n41\n\ncertification or engaged in a fishery improvement project (FIP) or Aquaculture Improvement Project (AIP). Tracked on the FishChoice platform, FisheryProgress.org. Publicly registered FIPs include FIPs and Pre- FIPs, both of which are registered with Fishsource.\n\n20 Includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. bananas. Results do not include volume from spot buys. Spot buy bananas may not qualify as certified \"more sustainable.\" Walmart defines \"more sustainable\" bananas as bananas that are certified by Rainforest Alliance, Sustainably Grown, or Fair Trade.\n\n21 Includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club U.S. combined coffee. Walmart defines \"more sustainable\" coffee as coffee sourced as certified by Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance Certified, or UTZ.\n\n22 Includes Walmart U.S. private brand black and green tea bags and instant iced teas as certified. Walmart defines \"more sustainable\" tea as tea sourced as certified by Rainforest Alliance.\n\n23 Annual Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions are updated from time to time for changes in emission factors or activity data when more accurate information become available. This may result in updated emissions reported in the ESG Climate Change brief that may not correspond to results reported to CDP for our annual Climate Change questionnaire.

It considers the combined contribution of power generated from on-site and off-site projects as well as renewable energy generation feeding into the grids where our sites are located. Third-party-verified energy consumption data is one year in arrears for the CY2019 and CY2020 years. For CY2021, the latest energy consumption data was used. This was used in combination with the electricity procured from our renewable energy projects and the most recent grid fuel mix information obtained from the International Energy Agency for the regions where we operate. This estimate does not include energy data for our Flipkart business. We believe excluding Flipkart data will have a negligible impact on our estimate.\n\n###PAGE###\n\nWalmart\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\n25 The U.S. product net sales figure used for the calculation includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club product net sales for the previous four quarters (Q3 through Q2) prior to the start of the survey reporting window. The percentage represents U.S. product net sales of suppliers that reported to Project Gigaton in the reporting year versus all U.S. product net sales. The calculation excludes Walmart International segment product net sales from the calculation.\n\n26 Calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, available on the Walmart Sustainability Hub. Suppliers submit information during a Project Gigaton reporting season; figures reported are for the reporting season that took place during the corresponding fiscal year.

Flipkart emissions data is excluded from Walmart's Scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint and progress calculation. We believe excluding Flipkart's data will have a negligible impact on the overall reporting. Our emissions footprint in CO2e is calculated to include emissions for our operations for the period in which we owned the operations in the reporting year. This may result in updated emissions reported not corresponding to results reported to CDP for our annual Climate Change questionnaire.\n\nWe engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify Walmart's reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as reported to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification of Greenhouse Gas inventories). We follow Walmart's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology in calculating our GHG emissions, which is consistent with the principles and guidance of the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (\"The GHG Protocol\") for corporate GHG accounting and reporting. The GHG Protocol outlines three emissions sources (referred to as \"scopes\") that provide the framework for operational boundaries. The three scopes are:\n\nScope 1, \"Direct Emissions,\" represent emissions from the combustible fuels and other sources that occur directly on sites (e.g., refrigerants,) and mobile emissions sources.\n\nScope 2, \"Indirect Emissions,\" represent emissions that occur off-site to produce electricity or steam purchased for use at corporate locations. Scope 3, \"Other Indirect Emissions,\" represents emissions from activities down or upstream from a company's core business such as product use, waste disposal, commuting, and business travel.\n\nScope 2 (market-based) emissions include the carbon reduction value of renewable electricity procured from onsite and offsite projects. To account for structural changes in our business, we strive to adjust our emission reduction progress on Scope 1 and 2 emissions to add or subtract emissions for entities acquired or divested in the year the acquisition or divestiture took place, including adjusting for previous years (including the baseline year).\n\n28 Calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, available on\n\nIntroduction Opportunity\n\nthe Walmart Sustainability Hub.

In cases where certified or otherwise documented weights were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on waste audits, historical data, extrapolation for similar facilities in size and scope, etc.\n\nWalmart's operational food waste reduction goal is aligned with Target 12.3 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Progress towards food loss and waste reduction goal measured in conformance with the Food Loss and Waste Protocol's Food Loss and Waste Accounting Standard (FLW Standard) for quantifying food and/or associated inedible parts removed from the food supply chain. This figure is based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes, as reported by waste vendors, food banks and stores. In cases where certified or otherwise documented weights were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on waste audits, historical data, extrapolation for similar facilities in size and scope, etc. The 2016 baseline was adjusted to remove markets (Argentina, Japan, U.K.) that have since been divested; reported reduction is as against this adjusted baseline.\n\n31 For the time frame of the private brands packaging survey, we instructed suppliers to use their latest or most recent 12-month period for which they have data available. If they reported last year, use the same reporting period as the initial/prior reporting year to avoid gaps or overlap with the prior year's submissions. For suppliers that did not complete the survey or provided unusable data, proxy data was substituted to provide a full estimate of global private brand packaging.

In cases where certified or otherwise documented weights were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on waste audits, historical data, extrapolation for similar facilities in size and scope, etc. Original goal covered U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K., and now includes Mexico. Walmart divested its retail operations in the U.K. and Japan in February and March of 2021, respectively.\n\n33 Where a facility is required to be disclosed to Walmart, \"Active\" status denotes that the supplier can use the facility for Walmart production.\n\nSustainability\n\nCommunity\n\nEthics & Integrity\n\n42\n\n34 Facility color ratings denote the seriousness of findings identified in the audits.\n\n35 Results are limited to net sales of Walmart and Sam's Club direct suppliers and do not include data from \"spot buy\" or \"direct store delivery\" suppliers. Direct suppliers represent 90% of Walmart U.S. net sales of the relevant department, and 89% of the Sam's Club U.S. net sales of the relevant department. The U.S. product net sales figure used for the calculation includes Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club product net sales for the previous four quarters (Q3 through Q2) prior to the start of the survey reporting window. The percentage represents U.S. product net sales of suppliers that reported to Ethical Charter in the reporting year versus all U.S. product net sales. The calculation excludes Walmart International segment product net sales from the calculation.\n\n36 Based on reports from Feeding America\n\n37 Based on reports from Feeding America.\n\n38 Total cash and in-kind donations includes combined philanthropic efforts of Walmart and the Walmart Foundation.\n\n39 Walmart measures its chemical footprint in terms of priority chemicals, or PCs based on supplier reports collected through UL WERCSmart for in-scope products sold. Walmart references regulatory and authoritative lists to determine priority chemicals. These lists can be found at https://www. walmartsustainabilityhub.com/sustainable-chemistry/implementation-guide/appendices. Our footprint covers in-scope formulated consumables products within beauty, personal care, baby, pet, and household cleaning products sold by Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs in the U.S. In any given year, an increase or decrease in UPC volume weight disclosures may impact reporting. To learn about formulation disclosure, please visit Section 2: Transparency of our Sustainable Chemistry Implementation Guide.\n\n40 Metrics presented correspond with information reported in Walmart's Annual Proxy Statements for the stated years; director metrics are based on nominees for election at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for each year.\n\n41 Metrics presented correspond with information reported in Walmart's Annual Proxy Statements for the stated years; director metrics are based on nominees for election at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting for each year.\n\n42 Walmart is a member of the Alliance for Connected Care and the American Telemedicine Association; we also are a member of the Consumer Technology Association.\n\n###PAGE###\n\nWalmart\n\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\n\nIntroduction\n\nOpportunity\n\nSustainability\n\nCommunity Ethics & Integrity\n\n43\n\nContact Us\n\nAdditional information about Walmart can be found by visiting us at corporate.walmart.com, on Linkedln, and on Twitter.\n\nYour feedback is important to us.
