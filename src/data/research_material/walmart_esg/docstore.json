Walmart's Information Security team helps to build and maintain the trust of our customers, associates, and stakeholders by securing our operating environment.\\n\\nOur team analyzes more than seven trillion alerts annually. To help manage the volume of threats, we are prioritizing automation, including by deploying leading third-party tools, supplementing them with our own purpose-built tools, and leveraging internal and external experts to enhance our automated threat management capabilities.\\n\\nOne alert that has become more prevalent - especially around the holidays - are retail bots, which are automated programs that purchase inventory online. As more holiday commerce volume has shifted online, we worked to eliminate these bots via automated, purpose-built capabilities that only allow legitimate customers to purchase products. Last year, we blocked approximately 8.5 billion bots per month.\\n\\n1:11 1 Exit\\n\\nScan & Go Cart .Il LTE Wn Fashion Tee $5.98 Qty 1 V Weighable produce (1)\\n\\n\u00c3\u2014\\n\\nYou'll be able to weigh produce at self checkout\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nSubtotal (2 items)\\n\\n$5.98\\n\\nTax\\n\\n$0.52\\n\\nEstimated total\\n\\n$6.50\\n\\n[ii] Scan items\\n\\nPEACH YELLOW HM $1.78/1b Cost to be calculated by weight\\n\\n\u00c3\u2014\\n\\nAdd item with no barcode Remove all items\\n\\nEstimated total $6.50\\n\\nCheck out\\n\\n###PAGE###\\n\\nWalmart\\n\\nFY2023 ESG Highlights\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOpportunity\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nCommunity\\n\\nEthics & Integrity\\n\\n37\\n\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nOur aspiration: to use our scale, capabilities, and influence to help people and communities improve their lives,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 61017, "end_char_idx": 63031, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "walmart_esg_32": {"__data__": {"id_": "walmart_esg_32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "426a47b2-2359-43c8-ad75-fd670c533c05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5137b573a9c483338257215ad448117a045ac5509f826eb54a4be59019af85f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd001849-c746-48ed-af2a-8aa189859f34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61f73a2b02154b2b32f212f40ebb8dd004b45982db21f893f1118694f0aa185d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8a39e5a-2c24-4616-bf07-562c5ac6a8e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34706fdbd57debbf0c2adcf31275270ec6fbb6dcd64989348d1f5b16c6b37157", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "capabilities, and influence to help people and communities improve their lives, with a focus on our salient human rights issues\\n\\nSALIENT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES\\n\\nWalmart focuses its efforts on its identified salient human rights issues:\\n\\nSTRATEGY\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 Identify salient human rights issues and focus areas most relevant to our business\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 Govern our approach to human rights in accordance with our Human Rights Statement, including oversight by management and the Walmart Board of Directors\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 Manage salient human rights issues in our operations and supply chains, including through policies, engagement, assessing impacts, integration of findings, performance tracking, and appropriate remedy\\n\\nFY2023 HIGHLIGHTS\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 >400 suppliers set goals and/or reported progress on responsible recruitment through Walmart's Supplier Leadership Program on People\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 Financially supported the creation of a data ecosystem and engagement channels to empower and promote the responsible recruitment of migrant workers in the U.S .- Mexico agriculture corridor\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 Began a refresh of our human rights due diligence approaches, including re-examining our salient issues, focus areas, governance, policies, and practices\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 Participated in the Owned Operations working group of the Consumer Goods Forum, which includes Human Rights Due Diligence activities\\n\\nTreating Workers with Respect\\n\\n\u00c2\u00b7 Pay;

Because Walmart does not restrict suppliers to reporting only on emissions avoidance and reduction efforts that are attributable to the suppliers' business with Walmart, actions taken and reported through Project Gigaton cannot be used to measure Walmart's Scope 3 emissions, either absolutely or in year-over-year reductions.\\n\\n30 Based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes, as reported by waste vendors, food banks, and stores. In cases where certified or otherwise documented weights were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on waste audits, historical data, extrapolation for similar facilities in size and scope, etc.\\n\\nWalmart's operational food waste reduction goal is aligned with Target 12.3 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Progress towards food loss and waste reduction goal measured in conformance with the Food Loss and Waste Protocol's Food Loss and Waste Accounting Standard (FLW Standard) for quantifying food and/or associated inedible parts removed from the food supply chain. This figure is based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes, as reported by waste vendors, food banks and stores. In cases where certified or otherwise documented weights were not available due to industry challenges, they have been estimated based on waste audits, historical data, extrapolation for similar facilities in size and scope, etc. The 2016 baseline was adjusted to remove markets (Argentina, Japan, U.K.) that have since been divested; reported reduction is as against this adjusted baseline.\\n\\n31 For the time frame of the private brands packaging survey, we instructed suppliers to use their latest or most recent 12-month period for which they have data available. If they reported last year, use the same reporting period as the initial/prior reporting year to avoid gaps or overlap with the prior year's submissions. For suppliers that did not complete the survey or provided unusable data, proxy data was substituted to provide a full estimate of global private brand packaging. For the proxy calculation, a market level approach was used.\\n\\n32 Based on review of material handling and waste diversion processes, as reported by waste vendors, food banks, and stores.
